Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` method?
    O(n)
2. What is the space complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` function?
    O(h)
3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method?
    O(n)
4. What is the space complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method? 
    O(w)
5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
    
6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
