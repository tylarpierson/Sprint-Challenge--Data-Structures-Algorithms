Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.
##Exercise 1
### a) O(n^3)
### b) O(log n)
### c) O(n^3)
### d) O(n^2)
### e) O(n^4)
### f) O(n)
### g) O(n)

##Exercise 2
### a) ``` return a[0] - a[a.length - 1];```
### b) start from the bottom floor and work your way up, dropping an egg at each level. As soon as the egg breaks, you've found f. 

##Exercise 3
### a) 0(n), because every list element will be greater, meaning that you will only have to run the sort algorithm once and iterate through the list.
### b) O(n log(n)), as you will need to split the array into two lists.
